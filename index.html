            <p>A majestic Winter Ball was hosted by the LGBT Network of Long Island on Friday, December 1st in commemoration of World AIDS Day. The annual event, which was held at Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury with over 300 Long Island attendees, preceded its silver anniversary this year. Over $10,000 were raised in funds, and the Network will use the proceeds to support HIV/AIDS testing, outreach, prevention, education, and support services.
            </p>
            <p>According to the CDC, as of 2016 there was an estimated over 1 million people within the United States living with HIV and over 6,700 resulted in deaths. “Long Island has the largest rate of infections of HIV out of any place in New York outside of New York City. In fact, Long Island has the largest rate of infections of any suburb in the entire country. That’s why your support tonight helps the LGBT Network to make sure that everyone gets tested, knows their status, and that were able to do the necessary advocacy that we need to do.” -David Kilmnick, Founder, President and CEO of LGBT Network

              According to Robert Vitelli, Chief Operating Officer, the LGBT Network is a non-profit that serves as “a home and a voice” for the LGBT Community, their families and support systems. The Network has four community centers that aim to help LGBT people to be themselves, stay healthy and to change the world. </p>
            <p>
              “We have a 24 year history of pioneering advocacy and social change,” says Vitelli, “not just within our community centers, but also in our range of more than 30 programs and services that reach and engage more than 200,000 people each year, but we also bring change where LGBT people live, learn, work, play and pray. Tonight’s event, Winter Ball, raises money for our HIV/AIDS services that work to stop the spread of HIV on Long Island.”

            <p>Santariello shares how she first got involved with the LGBT Network, her experience with HIV/AIDS during her acceptance speech. Santariello tells the story of how her former husband was diagnosed with HIV thirteen years ago, and she and her husband were told that they were both going to die.  </p>
            <p>“We were given no counseling, no advice, and no hope,” says Santariello. “I did my research, and worked hard on getting the information that we needed, to get him the proper treatment and medication.”
             <p> Although Santariello’s husband Chris sadly lost his battle with HIV, his legacy lived on. Santariello did not test positive for HIV, but she did whatever she could in her power to make sure that no one else would suffer the same fate as her husband did. </p>
            <p> “The LGBT Network is a leading HIV/AIDS service provider. With our help, volunteering and charitable assistance, we can make a difference so that no one has to walk into a dimly lit doctor’s office and be told that there is no hope, and no way to proceed with life,” says Santariello."

          <div class="text" data-swiper-parallax="-100">
            <p>David Kilmnick, expressed the importance of commemorating the event on World AIDS Day, to remember and honor those who lost their lives to the disease, those that are still living and to fight to make sure that we end the epidemic. </p>
            <p> Kilmnick mentioned in his speech, the decision carried out by the Trump Administration in lieu of World AIDS Day. He said "Trump did offer a World AIDS Day proclamation, and for the first time that they were issued, there was no mention of the LGBT community, and there was no mention of people of color. This should be an alarm to us and events like this, where we all come together as one community, is never more important.”</p>
            <p>When asked about how the honoree was picked, Kilmnick explained “it's about those who are brave enough to tell their stories and fight to make a difference. Diana shared her story about how she and her husband were treated, and she wants to make sure that no one else will go through that. We need to make sure that folks are treated with dignity, love, compassion and support, and we need a lot more of that in today’s world.”</p>

          <div class="text" data-swiper-parallax="-100">
            <p> Kilmnick hopes that with the help of people like Santariello, and the funds that continue to be raised, that the LGBT Network is able to support everyone in need of testing. He says “the funding that’s out there only funds testing up to the age of 29, and it only funds young, gay and bisexual men. We have about 300-400 women that come to us for testing. We have so many people over the age of 29 that come to us. Gay or non-gay. We don’t turn anyone away. We have to make sure that those that are living with HIV, get the dignity that they deserve, and the compassion and support services that they should have.”
