            <p>There is estimated over 1 million people within the United States that are living with HIV today, yet 1 in 7 might not know that they have it. But from 2008 to now, the annual number of HIV infections has gone down over eighteen percent. This is partly due to organizations like the LGBT Network who put in continous hours of effort to improve the outreach, education and support services that make all the difference. </p>

            <p>A majestic Winter Ball was hosted by the LGBT Network of Long Island on Friday, December 1st in commemoration of World AIDS Day. The annual event, which was held at Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury with over 300 Long Island attendees, preceded its silver anniversary this year. Over $10,000 were raised in funds, and the Nework will use the proceeds to support HIV/AIDS testing, outreach, prevention, education, and support services. 
            </p>
            <p>According to the CDC, as of 2016 there was an estimated over 1 million people within the United States living with HIV and over 6,700 resulted in deaths. “Long Island has the largest rate of infections of HIV out of any place in New York outside of New York City. In fact, Long Island has the largest rate of infections of any suburb in the entire country.  That’s why your support tonight helps the LGBT Network to make sure that everyone gets tested, knows their status, and that were able to do the necessary advocacy that we need to do.” -David Kilmnick, Founder, President and CEO of LGBT Network

              According to Robert Vitelli, Chief Operating Officer, the LGBT Network is a non-profit that serves as “a home and a voice” for the LGBT Community, their families and support systems. The Network has four community centers that aim to help LGBT people to be themselves, stay healthy and to change the world. </p>
            <p>
              “We have a 24 year history of pioneering advocacy and social change,” says Vitelli, “not just within our community centers, but also in our range of more than 30 programs and services that reach and engage more than 200,000 people each year, but we also bring change where LGBT people live, learn, work, play and pray. Tonight’s event, Winter Ball, raises money for our HIV/AIDS services that work to stop the spread of HIV on Long Island.”

Equality is a big deal, and they just want to be just like us. So we’re here to support them. We believe that they shouldn’t be in a separate group, they should be who they are.”</P>
            
          
              
            <p>Also in support of Diana were Leslie and Glenn Pfeiffer of Commack. “We came tonight in support of Diana Santariello and all the work that she does to promote AIDS research and to promote awareness. I certainly wanted to support her. She had let me know that she was being honored and I absolutely wanted to buy a ticket as soon as she told me.”</p>

          <div class="text" data-swiper-parallax="-100">


            <p>Santariello shares how she first go involved with the LGBT Network, her experience with HIV/AIDS during her acceptance speech. Santariello tells the story of how her former husband was diagnosed with HIV thirteen years ago, and she and her husband were told they they were both going to die. Santariello and her husband, Chris, were left with nothing but questions. </p>

            <p>“We were given no counseling, no advice, and no hope,” says Santariello. “I did my research, and worked hard on getting the information that we needed, to get him the proper treatment and medication.” 
              Although Santariello’s husband Chris sadly lost his battle with HIV, his legacy lived on, and although Santariello did not test positive for HIV, she did whatever she could in her power to make sure that no one else would suffer the same fate as her husband did. </p>

            <p> “The LGBT Network is a leading HIV/AIDS service provider. With our help, volunteering and charitable assistance, we can make a difference so that no one has to walk into a dimly lit doctor’s office and be told that there is no hope, and no way to proceed with life,” says Santariello. “There are so many advancements in medicine, and so many ways we can prolong and sustain life with people who are living with HIV.”

Kilmnick says “today, Trump did offer a World AIDS Day proclamation, and for the first time that the World AIDS Day proclamations were issued, there was no mention of the LGBT community, and there was no mention of people of color. This should be an alarm to us, along with everything else that is going on in our country. Events like this, where we all come together as one community, is never more important.”
